The choice of optimization algorithm depends on various factors, including the size and complexity of the neural network, the amount and quality of data available, and the desired level of accuracy. 
Ultimately, the choice of optimization algorithm should be based on its performance and efficiency in achieving the desired results. This can be evaluated by monitoring metrics such as the loss function and accuracy of the model during training, as well as the time and computational resources required to achieve the desired results.

In summary, while there is no definitive answer to which optimization algorithm works best for weight optimization of neural networks, selecting the right algorithm for a specific problem is crucial for achieving optimal results. Factors such as the size and complexity of the neural network, the amount and quality of data available, and the desired level of accuracy should be considered when selecting an optimization algorithm.
