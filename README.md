The choice of optimization algorithm depends on various factors, including the size and complexity of the neural network, the amount and quality of data available, and the desired level of accuracy. For example, gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm that works well for small to medium-sized neural networks, but may struggle to converge to the optimal solution for larger, more complex models.
